# Project Background
The project aims to build a prediction model to forecast the crime counts in the City of Chicago in the next 5 years using ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) Time Series approach. This dataset is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. Find more details [HERE](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crimes-one-year-prior-to-present)

# Approach
- The data that is used to build the forecast didn't include records in 2024 as the year hasn't ended.
- Prior to training the model, I used the following statistical tests to ensure the validity and reliability of the model:
    - ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) Test: Used to check the stationarity of the time series data. This test is crucial for determining whether differencing is needed to stabilize the mean of the series.
    - ACF (Autocorrelation Function) and PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function): Utilized to identify the appropriate lag values for the ARIMA model's autoregressive (p) and moving average (q) parameters.
    - Seasonal Decomposition: Applied to identify and isolate seasonality in the time series data, guiding the use of SARIMA over ARIMA for seasonal patterns
- Library used for ARIMA and SARIMA Model: statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax
  
# Main Findings

This graph illustrates a 5-year forecast of crime counts in the City of Chicago using the SARIMA Model with parameters (0,1,1)(1,1,1,12), which accounts for both trend differencing (d=1) and seasonal differencing (D=12) with a 12-month seasonal cycle. 

# Insight deep dive
### 1. Trend and Seasonality: The model captures the downward trend in crime counts observed in the historical data.
The projected crime counts for the next five years (2024â€“2028) show continued seasonal variations, indicating that certain times of the year may consistently experience higher or lower crime rates.
### 2. Confidence Intervals: The shaded gray area represents the 95% confidence interval of the forecast.
This range highlights the uncertainty in predictions, which increases over time, reflecting the inherent challenges in long-term forecasting.
### 3. Model Accuracy: This SARIMA Model (0,1,1)(1,1,1,12) is the most accurate model after comparing various non-seasonal and seasonal ARIMA models with different parameters. My evaluation was based on the following metrics:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE): Used to measure the average squared difference between observed and predicted values.
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Evaluated the average magnitude of errors in predictions.
   - Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC): Compared models based on their goodness-of-fit while penalizing for complexity.
